routerapp
=========

Application and framework for building open-source router appliances. 

This builds an web-based management system for general purpose, Linux-based
systems operating as routers. It also works with the Quagga suite of route
protocols.

This framework builds on the [Pycopia](http://www.pycopia.org/) application framework.
